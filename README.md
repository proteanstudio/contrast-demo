# Contrast tools

Hello, thanks for taking a look at our contrast tools built using the [Protean Design System](https://github.com/proteanstudio/design-system). 

The APCA demo is powered by the work done by [Myndex](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA).  Please take a look at the documentation provided by them and the corresponding [WCAG 3.0 Draft](https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/).

The WCAG 2.1 demo takes inspiration from [WebAIM's contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and the many other tools that have come before us.

If you have any problems or suggestions, please open an [issue](https://github.com/proteanstudio/contrast-demo/issues) and we'll take a look as soon as we can.
